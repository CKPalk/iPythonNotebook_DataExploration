review/text: On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.

review/text: On tap at the John Harvards in Springfield PA.  Pours a ruby red amber with a medium off whie creamy head that left light lacing.  Aroma of orange and various other citrus.  A little light for what I was expecting from this beers aroma...expecting more from the Simcoe.  Flavor of pine, orange, grapefruit and some malt balance.  Very light bitterness for the 80+ IBUs they said this one had.

Lively yet thin and watery body. Oh yeah, the person seating me told me this was a new one and was a Pale Ale even though the menu he gave me listed it as a lighter beer brewed in the Kolsh style.

Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head). Ill stop on the cask version here as I found it to smell and taste like buttered popcorn. The regular had aromas of nuts, light chocolate, and roast. Taste of chocolate, nuts, very light roast and caramel.	 Tasted on 9/7/2006 and moved over as part of the John Harvard clean up.

Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, clove, banana, and cherries, with light roastiness.  Aroma was very dubbelish.  Herbal taste of dark fruits, yeast and alcohol was barely noticed.  Slick mouthfeel.  Could have been more flavorful.

review/text: UPDATED: FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Darkish copper colored, with no head -	probably poured like that on purpose.	Served inappropriately at about 40 deg	F.  This beer was cold.  It tasted	fine at that temp but I had to let it warm up 	for awhile.  It was worth the wait, as a	very interesting and complex character developed.	Very phenolic and funky - with a strong ester of	bubblegum.  Also a little clove or some kind of 	spice.  Strong but not overwhelming at all.  Surpisingly	easy to drink.

Slight smokey flavor with a bourbon taste in the initial sip. Flavors of malt, vanilla and hops still remain although none dominate the brew. Taste is still very enjoyable with a smooth and balanced finish.

Aroma of sweet toasty pale malt and sweet light fruitiness with a good resiny piny hop character.  Body starts with decent fullness and sweet caramel malts with good balance of hop flavor and bitterness.  Finishes smooth and bittersweet, nicely aged and balanced.

review/text: UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 On tap. Interesting experiment, but I liked regular Hopula better. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma is slightly wood and hops, but mostly bourbon. Flavor is everything I loved about Hopula, but with too much booze. Some nice vanilla notes, but bourbon constantly overpowers the Hopula. Just not my style, but would be very interesting if they reused the barrels.

Flavor is strong bourbon, too strong.  The base beer is hidden under there somewhere but is way overpowered.  I had trouble getting it down to be honest.

review/text: Cask at GTMW.  Poured coppery-amber with a loose cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up an interesting interplay of juicy floral notes, sweet bourbon, and vanilla.. unfortunately interesting in a way that they didnt really go together.. muted the IIPA-ness greatly.  The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel.

Flavor brings forward some toasted malts but quickly falls back to doughy yeast, oak and brett giving it a nice funky sour finish.  Palate is tart and creamy.  A fantastic sour that would draw some attention if it got out of the brewery.

review/text: I was surprised by this one. A really nice local sour beer. Pours a great looking brown with a slight red hue. Not much head, but a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nutty, with cherries and a tartness to it. Very earthy. Flavor is nice and sour, lots of red fruits and nuts, with just a hint of yeast. The wood really comes into play here, and works nicely with the other elements. This one is tasty for sure.

Taste is smooth, clean brown style malt with a perfectly balanced sour profile bringing in the brett flavor. I was skeptical of the at first, but it came out quite nicely IMHO. On the lighter side in terms of sour intensity, but the overall taste is very pleasant.

review/text: Bottle and served in my big old Tripel Karmeliet glass: Deep brown and has a mostly lasting frothy bubbles with spotty lace. The aroma has notes of bakers chocolate, toasty and charred malt, prune and starfruit esters, star anise, floral and herbal hops, a hint of rubber and pipe tobacco. The taste has a Schwarzbier like dry toasty black malt character with a ripened fruity backbone. A bit sugary in midesection and anise spice all over the place. Peaty bite and a hint of sea salt too. The mouth feel is the weak part of the beer, sort of just sits there on the palate offering nothingness. A good beer for what it is but I think I would rather have a New Belgium 1554 first.

review/text: This pours a clear chestnut body with a slender beige ring in place of a head.  No lacing.  The aroma is lightly roasted malt, faint floral scents, dark brown sugar, and licorice.  All remain in the flavor, which is a bit thin, the body being somewhat watery, with the addition of a soft dark fruitiness.  The aftertaste is one of licorice, not overbearing and annoying, but subtle.  Not bad.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Liquors, Porter, IN<font size=-1>

review/text: 22 oz bottle pours a dark chestnut body with a one inch khaki head. Aroma is subtle, with perfumey florals, anise, and a sweet maltiness. Medium body supports some dark roasty notes, candy sugar, anise, dark fruits, and floral hops. Nicely complex and a good sipper.

review/text: Pints from BI at release party - This is going to be BIs entry for the ProAm category at GABF - Aroma is yeasty bubblegum and dark malts with a floral hint.  Pours very dark brown with a medium head and good lacing.  Flavor is roasted dark malts, bubblegum yeast, candi sugar and a touch of hops.  Palate is clean and a little sticky.  Hides alcohol well and is overall an easy drinking tasty brew.  Soon to be released in 22oz bottles.

review/text: Poured into a snifter. Sinister Minister pours an extremely rich mahogany, with a slightly tan head, with a low retention rate, which leads to decent lacing. Aromas are of sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Sweet malty taste, spices, fall fruits, molasses. It kind of reminds me of a less carbonated Trois Pistoles. Crisp, clean and smooth mouthfeel. Not as carbonated which is nice. Very good drinkability. This is the first pro-am I have had, and it is a great one to start with.

review/text: 22 oz botle.  Pours a clear chestnut brown body with a small fizzy light brown head.  The nose is nutty and yeasty, with some light coffee and dark fruits.  Lots of Belgian yeast character here in the flavor.  Some dark fruits, heavy yeast, a little coffee on the back end, and finishes off with a bit of peppery alcohol.  Medium bodied with a somewhat watery texture and fizzy carbonation.  I wish that this were a little softer and rounder feeling.  OK beer, but nothing great.

Flavor is a little weaker than expected but what is there is quite good.  Dark roasted grains, more cocoa, pasty malts, some burnt biscuits and an underlying tartness.  Little bit dry on the palate.  Light alcohol presence and warming.  Finishes roasty and malty.  A decent Belgian Ale.  Thanks to **** for this one.

review/text: 2007 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2009	An average pour into my 25cl tulip glass leaves me with three-fingers of lightly browned, light tan colored head.  The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.		Lightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.		Other than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.

The flavor had bready malts, slightly fruity, dusty, yeast, but there seems to be something wrong.  I wasnt sure how old this was, but it appears as if this is in a downward spiral.  Medium bodied.  I should try this again when I know its fresher.

review/text: 22oz bottle from StFun. Thanks, Josh. Nice brown pour, with some glinting red in the appearance and a lively carbonation. The nose was rich and very fruity, and this more or less characterizes the taste as well. I was expecting something with more bitterness, and some roasted flavors. This actually comes across far more like a dubbel than anything else, though certainly an enjoyable one. Lively mouthfeel, tasty blend of ripe dark fruits and malts, long finish. Tasty beer.

review/text: Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.		her sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.		Overall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.

review/text: UPDATED: MAY 8, 2009 Richmond Summer Gathering. Bomber courtesy of jcwattsrugger. Clear, deep brown with a thin, ringed tan head. Mild coffee and chocolate nose, yeasty, seemed a bit infected to me, with some sour nut notes. Didnt really seem to crop up in the flavor. OK - Id like to get another one of these and re-rate.		Re-rate, Daytona 500 tasting. 750 from DragonStout, IIRC. Much better this go-round, none of the sour nut I noted before. Rate reflects this bottle.

review/text: Courtesy SoLan.  Pours dark brown, with a small off white head.  Smells a bit Belgian, some candy sugar, dark malts, and molasses make up the nose.  The flavor consists of some spices and a sweet malty presence.  Got a bit of graham cracker and caramel in there as well.  Kind of uniqu, but wasnt really getting me too exicted.  Certainly drinkable, but lacking a bit of something.

review/text: Bomber from Crown.  Herbal nose with heather and some tire air.  Pours the deep brown of a porter, with a short light brown head.  Taste is dry and roasty but still has those herbal notes (which endure into the aftertaste, where they approach juniper and give a slightly chalky residue) and flashes of fruity sweetness.  Dark chocolate, loads of anise, licorice, but very little of the latter.  Body is watery and a bit foamy, slightly tangy but without acidity.  Refreshing and dangerously easy to drink!  Smooth and subtle, a good bridge between new and old, one of the more interesting finds of this year!

review/text: Sampled at Noog4.  Dark Chestnut pour with a light head.  Bright and bubbly aroma with Belgian funk and a touch of roasted grain.  Nice.  Very drinkable.  Its light with a well balanced combination of grain, hay, funk, and roasted grain.  Carbonated to the point that it exaggerates its refreshing properties.  Light-medium body.  This is an easy drinker.

review/text: Bottle picked up in South Bend; poured a rich, dark brown with a small to medium off white head.  Aroma of dark fruit, banana, yeast, roasted malt and chocolate.  Was pretty thin and a bit watery.  Flavor reminded me of a black lager, with some spice, nuts and a general earthiness.  Easily drinkable, but it just didnt come together that well.

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bottle and served in a tulip.  This beer poured an almost black with some mahogany highlights and a one-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly faded into a thin cap.  The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate, dark fruits, and some earthy, fruity yeast esthers as well.  The flavor of the beer consisted of spicy yeast, chocolate, plums, raisins, and a hint of smoke.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of crisp, aggressive carbonation.  Not bad.

Flavor his sweet and spicy that tingles the thin mouthfeel. I did find it very refreshing and good. I was just disappointed with the appearance since it literally looked like I was drinking a flat Coke or Pepsi with no ice in my pint glass.

review/text: From MI2CA, thanks for going through all the effort to find this for me, a trade that was months in the making.  Pours a dark brown, almost black color.   Aroma is what I was hoping for, new and different.  There is an orange/licorice spice coming out, not sure what it is but its but its not overbearing, just there.   Taste is light dark biscuit with light sweet earthiness to it.  Very easy drinking and has none of the typical Belgian yeast dominance. I think its very quaffable with its low bitterness.  Its a nice obscure style and I wish I could try more like this.22oz bomber, Rodenbach smaller tulip glass.
